# SOAR Project

For this project, I wanted to create a playbook that will send a Slack message and an email with details about a detection from LimaCharlie. Next, I will prompt the user if they want to isolate the machine based off the details received. Finally, I would isolate the machine using LimeCharlie if the user agrees, or send a message indicating no isolation if they decline. I did my best to draw that up here:
